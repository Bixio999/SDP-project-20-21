# SDP-project-20-21
My University project implementation for Distributed and Pervasive Systems. It uses ring network, MQTT, REST server and gRPC. More on README. 

At the moment a full explained README about the functionalities and specs of the project has not be done, but in SCHEME.pdf you can find some easy-to-read schemes about the project and the functionalities implemented. However currently they are written in italian, they will be translated soon, but all the source code is fully commented in english.
